# WWCD Now Playing
For MacOS only: A python script to display the currently playing song on WWCDradio.com in the menubar.

Requires you to have Python 3.x installed.

The code is pretty self-explanatory. Just plop the Python script in a local directory, navigate to that directory in the command line, and run it by typing `python 929.py`. The "now playing" in your menubar will refresh every 40 seconds. You can find that towards the bottom of the script. Feel free to change it if you want, but don't go crazy and break their server with zillions of requests.

Viva independent radio, viva Columbus, and viva WWCD. Thank you, Randy Malloy.
